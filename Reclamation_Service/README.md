# 🛠️ **Reclamation Service**

This microservice handles user **reclamations (complaints/feedback)** in a distributed microservice-based application. It supports adding, retrieving, and processing complaints, along with generating QR codes and PDF reports.

---

## 📦 **Technologies Used**

- **Java 17** – The primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot 3** – Framework used for building the application.
- **Spring Data JPA** – For data persistence.
- **Spring Cloud** – Includes Eureka Client for service discovery and Spring Cloud Config for externalized configuration.
- **H2 Database** – In-memory database for development and testing.
- **Docker** – For containerizing the microservice.
- **QR Code Generation** – For generating unique QR codes for reclamations.

---

## 🚀 **How to Run**

### **Prerequisites**

Before running the service, make sure you have the following installed:

- **JDK 17+**
- **Maven** – For building the project.
- **Docker** (optional but recommended)
- **Eureka Server** – Running on `http://localhost:8761/` for service discovery.
- **Spring Cloud Config Server** – Running on `http://localhost:8888/` for externalized configuration.

### **Running with Docker**

1. **Build the JAR:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean package
Build the Docker image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t reclamation_service .
Run the Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8084:8084 --name reclamation_service reclamation_service
Make sure port 8084 is available, or modify the port if necessary.

Accessing the Service
Once the service is running, it will be available at:
http://localhost:8084/

Eureka Server & Config Server
Ensure your Eureka Server is running at http://localhost:8761/ to allow the service to register.

The Spring Cloud Config Server should be running at http://localhost:8888/ to provide external configuration.

🌐 Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/reclamations/hello	Test endpoint to say "Hello" from the Reclamation Service.
POST	/reclamations	Add a new reclamation (complaint).
GET	/reclamations	Retrieve all reclamations.
GET	/reclamations/{id}	Retrieve a specific reclamation by ID.
PUT	/reclamations/{id}	Update an existing reclamation by ID.
DELETE	/reclamations/{id}	Delete a reclamation by ID.
GET	/reclamations/{id}/qr	Generate a QR code for a specific reclamation.
GET	/reclamations/qr/{filename:.+}	Retrieve the QR code image for a reclamation.
GET	/reclamations/pdf	Download all reclamations as a PDF document.
QR Code Generation
Each reclamation can generate a unique QR code that includes details such as the reclamation ID, description, order ID, status, and client email.

The QR code can be accessed through the endpoint GET /reclamations/{id}/qr.

You can retrieve the generated QR code image by visiting GET /reclamations/qr/{filename}.

# Reclamation Service Configuration

# Application Name and Port
spring.application.name=ReclamationService
server.port=8084

# H2 Database Configuration (for development and testing)
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:./Database/Data/reclamation
spring.datasource.username=chaher
spring.datasource.password=

# Spring Cloud Config
spring.cloud.config.enabled=true
spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
Database Configuration
The service uses an H2 database for development purposes. You can access the H2 database console at http://localhost:8084/h2 when the application is running.

Eureka & Config Server
The application registers with Eureka for service discovery.

The Spring Cloud Config Server loads externalized configurations.
